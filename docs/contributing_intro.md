# Hello Contributor - welcome to Spree!

You’re here to help, great. We’re here to help you help us. Spree is an open source project. Anyone can use the code, but more importantly, anyone can contribute. This is a group effort and we value your input. Please consider making a contribution to help improve the Spree project.

Before you start, we’ll ask you to do a bit of reading.
You will find all you need in this book. Don't worry, it's not much :)

* Contributor guidelines
* Style issues, we’ve got your back. Have a look here.
* Not sure what to work on?
* Rules! We’ve got rules. We really want your help, but we’ve got some standards to uphold. Please make sure your contribution doesn’t break any of these.

Phew, now that that’s out of the way, what are you waiting for? Start contributing!

## Not sure what to work on?

Here are some ways **you** can contribute:

* by using prerelease versions / master branch
* by reporting [bugs](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/new)
* by [translating to a new language](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n/tree/master/config/locales)
* by writing or editing [documentation](http://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/contributing.html#contributing-to-the-documentation)
* by writing [specs](https://github.com/spree/spree/labels/NeedSpecs)
* by writing [needed code](https://github.com/spree/spree/labels/NeedCode) or [finishing code](https://github.com/spree/spree/labels/stalled)
* by [refactoring code](https://github.com/spree/spree/labels/performance)

## Who can contribute?

Spree is an open source project and as such contributions are always welcome. Our community is one which encourages involvement from all developers regardless of their ability level. We ask that you be patient with the other members of the community, and maintain a respectful attitude towards other people's work. Open source is a great way to learn a new technology so don't be afraid to jump right in, even if you are new to Ruby/Rails.

## Before you contribute

Open source projects tend to be a collaborative effort. Since many people are relying upon Spree for their real world applications, changes to the code can have major implications. Before you write a bug fix or code a new feature, you should find out if anybody is interested in your proposed change. You may find that the thing you're trying to "fix" is actually desired behavior. You might also discover that someone else is working on it. Either way you can save yourself valuable time by announcing your intentions before starting work.

## Mailing List

One of the best places for communication is the [spree-user mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user). You can search this list of previous discussions, and get a sense for whether you're trying to address something new.

## IRC

There is a #spree chat room on the irc.freenode.net network. Sometimes the core contributors hang out there and you can get some feedback on your idea. More information on how to connect is on our [blog](http://spreecommerce.com/blog/irc-101).

Note: _The #spree chat room is not monitored as carefully as the mailing list. Sometimes you'll get lucky and someone will answer your question, but we can't provide real time responses to everyone with a question/problem/idea. The mailing list is a much better way to communicate, and it gives everyone the chance to provide a thoughtful response. It's also more permanent than anything discussed on IRC._

## Feature Requests

We're interested in hearing your ideas for new features, but creating feature requests in the Issue Tracker is not the proper way to ask for a feature. A feature request is any idea you have to improve the software experience that is not strictly related to a bug or error of omission.

Note: _Feature requests without accompanying code will be closed immediately. We simply cannot respond efficiently to feature requests through our Issue Tracker. If you want to suggest a feature, please use the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user)._
